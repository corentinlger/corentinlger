### Welcome on my GitHub 

Hi, I am Corentin, an engeneering student specialized in artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in cognitive and social sciences (neurosciences, psychology, sociology...) and AI (Machine learning, Evolutionnary Algorithms..) and would love to contribute in projects involving both of these fields !

I am currently interested in Reinforcement Learning, and how it can be improved with other methods (Symbolic AI, Meta-Learning...) in certain contexts, so don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on projects related !
