### Welcome on my GitHub âœ¨

Hi, I am Corentin, an engeneering student specialized in artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in cognitive and social sciences (neurosciences, psychology, sociology...) and AI (Machine learning, Evolutionnary Algorithms..) and would love to contribute in projects involving both of these fields !

I am currently focusing on Reinforcement Learning and its combiniation with other techniques (Symbolic AI, Deep Learning...), so don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on projects related. Thanks for reading !
